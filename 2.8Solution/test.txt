#Bears players on the roster bubble I‚Äôll be watching vs. the Bills:

‚Ä¢ Travis Bell
‚Ä¢ Mykal Walker
‚Ä¢ Kindle Vildor
‚Ä¢ Greg Stroman
‚Ä¢ Alex Leatherwood
‚Ä¢ Kendall Williamson

Think 1-2 of these guys make the team, but which ones? Could depend on what happens on Saturday.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs still a competition.‚Äù ‚Äî Bears coach Matt Eberflus on the team‚Äôs No. 2 quarterback for Saturday. 

He won‚Äôt say who it is but you can tell the team is impressed by rookie Tyson Bagent.

‚ÄúThat was created by pure competition,‚Äù Eberflus said.
